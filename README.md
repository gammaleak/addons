Gamma Leak's / Asura.Nalocbar's Windower Addons
-----------------------------------------------

These are just my person edits/tracking for Windower 4 addons.

**Use at your own risk!** Most things should work out of the box. Some will fail if your setup isn't quite like mine when it comes to referencing information that is outside of the repository (e.g., XIPivot DATs). I think the failures will be graceful (i.e., you won't get a crash or serious problems), but you never know.

Please note that if you make use of these, the init.txt file should go in your ..\Windower\scripts\ folder.
